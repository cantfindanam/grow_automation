### 🛠️ Note
PWM capability depends on available GPIOs and internal resources. Some boards may have certain pins occupied due to integrated modules (e.g., LCD, camera, GPS).  
For GrowBot use, ensure enough free I/Os — especially for:
- Sensors (I2C, UART)
- Actuators (PWM, relays)
- Expansion (e.g., I²C multiplexer, ADC)

### 🛠️ Notes for ESP32 Integration
- **I²C sensors** (BME280, SHT31, LM75A, etc.) can be used in parallel — ideal for multiple measurements
- **DS18B20** is great for outdoor or liquid monitoring (waterproof, long cable support)
- **DHT22** is widely used, but slower than others
- **Analog sensors** need an **ADC-capable GPIO pin** (not all ESP32 pins support ADC well)
- For **high-accuracy or industrial use**, **MAX31865 + PT1000** is an excellent solution

### 💧 Notes on Selection and Use:

- **EC sensors** measure the **electrical conductivity** of the nutrient solution — crucial for dosing accuracy.
- **pH sensors** are **temperature-sensitive** and need **regular calibration** (e.g., pH 4/7/10 buffer solutions).
- For use **in substrate**, probes must be durable and should be cleaned regularly.
- Many sensors use a **BNC connector**, allowing flexible electrode swapping.
- **Atlas Scientific** products are expensive but highly accurate and modular — suitable for professional setups.
- **DFRobot** offers a good balance of price and performance for DIY projects with ESP32.
